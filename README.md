# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Link to webpage: https://mjonas14.github.io/MyCalendar/

Hello and welcome to my daily Calendar with planning capabilities. The webpage offers the user time blocks for the regular business hours of the day, with the functionality to add events to various time periods, and the best thing is, once you refresh the page the event stays!

Hopefully this can provide you with some aided planning to organise your day. 

## Usage

THis usage of this webpage is very simple. 

At the top of the page you can see the date and time of when the page was opened. 

Each time period in the calendar has the ability to have text added to it. This is so that event can be detailed for the time they are happening. Once an event has been added, click save to save the detail to local storage. This allows you to refresh the page and still have the detail remain in your calendar. 

If an event is to be removed from the calendar, simply click the delete button on the right and the event will be removed from the calendar, and from local storage so that when the page is refreshed the event is no longer there. 

The save and delete buttons look like this:

Each time period is colour coded for past (gray), present (red) and future (green), as follows:
